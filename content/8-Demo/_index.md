### Reference Video Demo for the entire lab

In the Reference Video Demo section, you will experience a visual walkthrough of the entire process of deploying an intelligent image recognition system with Amazon Rekognition and the Serverless Stack. The video will guide you step-by-step, from configuring AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, and S3 to image processing: uploading images to the system, analyzing images via Rekognition, and storing analysis results in S3. Through the video, you will clearly see how these components connect and interact in practice, helping you easily visualize and grasp the process, while also providing tips and techniques to apply to your own project.
