# Intelligent Image Recognition with Amazon Rekognition and Serverless Stack

### Overall

In this lab, you will learn the basic concepts and practice using Amazon Rekognition â€“ a powerful AI image recognition service, and how to implement a Serverless Stack solution. You will practice creating automated pipelines to analyze and recognize images using Amazon Rekognition, while integrating Serverless services such as AWS Lambda, S3, and API Gateway to build an intelligent image processing system.
